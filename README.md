# Automated Testing Samples - Fork by Emily Bache

This is a sample project to illustrate some aspects of a 'good' automated test. 

It was created along with the blog post [Anatomy of a Good Test](https://www.innoq.com/en/blog/anatomy-of-a-good-test/) 
written by [@jacek_bilski](https://twitter.com/jacek_bilski) and [@torstenmandry](https://twitter.com/torstenmandry). Additional tests were written by [Emily Bache](https://github.com/emilybache) to illustrate 'good' automated test design with Approval Testing, alongside her video ["How Approval Tests Measure Up Against Kent Beckâ€™s Desiderata"](https://youtu.be/S71ku1VSik8).

The sample code is written in Java. The test code is based on [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/), 
[Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/), [AssertJ](https://assertj.github.io/doc/) and [Approvals.Java](https://github.com/approvals/approvaltests.java).

The changes made by Emily Bache are clear from the git commit history. The aim was not to change existing code, but to illustrate additional testing techniques. New files added by Emily Bache do not fall under the copyright of innoQ Deutschland GmbH, see the [Copyright Notice](NOTICE).
